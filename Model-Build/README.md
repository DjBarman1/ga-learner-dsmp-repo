### Project Overview

 Housing price needs to be predicted with different features being given


### Learnings from the project

 Learnt the different regression models -create and implement-and regularization and how to check the scores of each model using r2 score


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Analyzed the data and split into train-test set after loading in a dataframe. Then used Linear regression on features to predict the target variable after training the the train set.The model is then checked for its r2 score  and applied regularization methods to check which gives the best score. The polynomial model is then implemented to check the prediction.


### Challenges faced

 Was stuck in fitting polynomial feature but could overcome the problem after going through the course material again.


### Additional pointers

 Nice  explanation and good examples
