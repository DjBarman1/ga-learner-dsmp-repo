### Project Overview

 Probability of Loan approval and how it is related to other factors like income and credit scores


### Learnings from the project

 Basic concepts of probablity - conditional probability, visualization of discrete and continuous variables


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Covered the topics of concepts of probability and solved the problems using both formulae and logic utilizing the modules of python


### Challenges faced

 conditional probability is bit tricky , so used both logic and formulae to solve the problems


### Additional pointers

 Visualization was intersting and got the basic idea of how continuous and discrete variables look in bar plots. Application of conditional probabilities was tricky and interesting as well
