### Project Overview

 Insurance claim using Logistic regression


### Learnings from the project

 Implementation of Logistic,Gridsearch,ROC and AUC curves


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Using GridSearch found out the accuracy of the prediction and then checked the plot the fpr vs tpr as well as our auc for the classifier


### Challenges faced

 Calculating the ROC and AUC was tricky but went through the topics once again to plot the ROC


### Additional pointers

 ROC and AUC are good metrics to check the classifier
